# Slack Archiver
Them there slack json logs are great. This turns them into plain text

1. Download and unzip the slack export
2. Run `ruby slack-to-txt.rb <name-of-channel>` from within the export
   directory
3. Profit!


## TODO

1. Make `slack-to-text` an executable
2. Allow slack-to-txt to be ran from any directory
